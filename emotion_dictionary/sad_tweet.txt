Why do we torture ourselves... Why is it so hard for us to be happy? 

It's not.. We just make it so Humans

I will stop when i feel beautiful. Please don't try anymore to make me eat.

i wan things to be back the way they used to be.

Nothing hurts more than realizing he meant everything to you, but you meant nothing to him.

A million words would not bring you back, I know because I tried. Neither would a million tears, I know because I cried.

You hurt me more than I deserve, how can you be so cruel? I love you more than you deserve, why am I such a fool?

It's hard to pretend that you love someone when you don't, but it's even harder to pretend that you don't love someone when you really do.

The hardest thing to do is waking up without you.

You've wronged me too many times to be able to make this right.

Don't let me go.

I try really hard, but I can't forget.

I always thought there'd be light at the end of the road.
